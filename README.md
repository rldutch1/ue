UltraEdit Stuff

Control + Spacebar:
Control + Spacebar will show the templates if you type enough of the characters in the name of the template. This is necessary if you have multiple template that start with the same characters but they are in different environments. UltraEdit does not know which environment to display the template so it does not display anything until you press Control + Spacebar and you will see templates from all environments. This topic is at the 09:00 minute mark of this video (https://www.ultraedit.com/support/tutorials-power-tips/ultraedit/smart-templates.html).
