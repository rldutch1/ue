alter user '[+dbusername+]'@'%' identified by '[+dbpassword+]';

-- Method 4 (Preferred method for another user.):
alter user set password for '[+dbusername+]'@'localhost' = '[+dbpassword+]';

-- ALTER USER EXAMPLES ==
ERROR 1820 (HY000): You must reset your password using ALTER USER statement before executing this statement.

-- This worked for me from the MySQL DB prompt:
	SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('[+dbpassword+]');
-- Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33467337/reset-mysql-root-password-using-alter-user-statement-after-install-on-mac

-- This syntax enables changing your own password without naming your account literally.
	ALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY '[+dbusername+]';

-- This statement changes the password for [+dbusername+] but leaves that for someother[+dbusername+] unchanged.
-- For both accounts, connections are required to use SSL and each account can be used for a maximum of two simultaneous connections:
	ALTER USER
  	'[+dbusername+]'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '[+dbpassword+]',
  	'someother[+dbusername+]'@'localhost'
  	REQUIRE SSL WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 2;

-- Example 1: Change an account's password and expire it. As a result, the user must connect with the named password and choose a new one at the next connection:
	ALTER USER '[+dbusername+]'@'localhost'
  	IDENTIFIED BY '[+dbpassword+]' PASSWORD EXPIRE;

-- Example 2: Modify an account to use the sha256_password authentication plugin and the given password. Require that a new password be chosen every 180 days:
	ALTER USER '[+dbusername+]'@'localhost'
  	IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY '[+dbpassword+]'  (SHA256 may require an SSL connection on some systems)
  	PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 180 DAY;

-- Example 3: Lock or unlock an account:
	ALTER USER '[+dbusername+]'@'localhost' ACCOUNT LOCK;
		ALTER USER '[+dbusername+]'@'localhost' ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

-- Example 4: Require an account to connect using SSL and establish a limit of 20 connections per hour:
	ALTER USER '[+dbusername+]'@'localhost'
  	REQUIRE SSL WITH MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 20;
