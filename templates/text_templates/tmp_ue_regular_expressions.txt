Within the context of UltraEdit and UEStudio, regular expressions (or regex, for short) are patterns (rather than specific strings) that are used with find and replace. There are many ways that regular expressions may be used to streamline operations and enhance efficiency. We have listed below a reference key for both UltraEdit's proprietary legacy regex and Unix style regex, as well as some examples to demonstrate how to use them in the editor.

	Tagged expressions may be used to mark various data members so that they may be reorganized, reformatting the data. For example, it might be useful to be able to rearrange:
